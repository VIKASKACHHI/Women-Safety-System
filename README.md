# Women-Safety-System
AI-driven surveillance system presents a transformative approach to enhancing women's safety in urban areas.

our project proposes an AI-driven surveillance system that focuses on real-time threat detection, prevention, and intervention. This solution tackles the unpredictability of crimes against women, which are often opportunistic and sudden. Existing systems suffer from being reactive, and law enforcement is typically involved only after a crime has been reported, which leaves women vulnerable during critical moments.

Our proposed system integrates several innovative features:

Gender Classification: The AI identifies and classifies individuals by gender using live video feeds from surveillance cameras. This allows the system to monitor gender ratios and flag potential risks, such as a woman being alone in an area with a disproportionate number of men.

Real-Time Threat Detection: The system continuously monitors public spaces, detecting suspicious behavior and anomalies. When a potential threat is identified, such as a woman being surrounded by multiple men, the system generates tiered alerts. Low-level alerts may notify security personnel, while higher-level alerts trigger immediate action, such as dispatching law enforcement.

Behavioral and Body Language Analysis: The AI analyzes body language to predict potential threats, such as aggressive postures or signs of distress. If it detects a woman showing fear or attempting to move away from someone pursuing her, the system triggers a higher-level alert and initiates the appropriate response.

Continuous Learning: The AI system continuously learns from new data and past incidents to improve threat detection accuracy over time. As the system encounters more real-world situations, it refines its ability to recognize genuine threats and prevent incidents from escalating.

Strategic Deployment: The system can be deployed in high-crime areas, public transportation hubs, and poorly lit spaces, where the risk to women is highest. This strategic placement ensures that the technology is used where it can have the greatest impact.

SOS Signal Recognition: The system can recognize SOS signals, including emergency gestures and sign language, allowing women to discreetly signal for help when they cannot call for assistance vocally. This ensures that even non-verbal cries for help are detected and addressed quickly.

Overall, this AI-driven solution offers a proactive, real-time approach to women's safety, reducing the risk of harm and providing women with the confidence to navigate public spaces. By focusing on prevention, continuous learning, and strategic deployment, the system has the potential to make a lasting impact on women's safety in urban areas.


How to run :-

This Project contains 2 ML Models one for SOS sign detection and another for Gender classification and alert generation when women is alone . Just run the python Code in your VS code and the model will take input from your system camera.
